## Files Analyzed

### Storage Layer (storage/)
| File | Line Coverage | Issues |
|------|--------------|---------|
| factory.ts | 68.42% | Missing test coverage for error paths and edge cases |
| index.ts | 0% | No tests - simple export file |
| json-storage.ts | 93.64% | Good coverage, minor gaps in error handling |
| sqlite-storage.ts | 82.66% | Missing coverage for migration and error recovery |

## Files Needing Tests

### Priority 1 - Core Components (No Tests)
1. **knowledge-graph-manager.ts** - Core business logic, needs comprehensive unit tests
2. **server-factory.ts** - Server initialization logic
3. **server-factory-schemas.ts** - Schema validation logic
4. **http-server.ts** - HTTP transport layer
5. **health-server.ts** - Health check endpoints

### Priority 2 - Support Components (No Tests)
1. **src/memory/monitoring/health.ts** - Health monitoring
2. **src/memory/monitoring/logger.ts** - Logging infrastructure
3. **src/memory/monitoring/metrics.ts** - Metrics collection
4. **src/memory/monitoring/server.ts** - Monitoring server
5. **src/memory/security/validator.ts** - Security validation

### Priority 3 - Storage Extensions (No Tests)
1. **src/memory/storage/cache.ts** - Caching layer
2. **src/memory/storage/connection-pool.ts** - Connection pooling
3. **src/memory/storage/optimized-sqlite-storage.ts** - Optimized storage

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Unit Test Gaps
- Factory error handling paths
- SQLite migration and recovery scenarios
- Schema validation edge cases
- Error boundary testing

### Integration Test Gaps
- End-to-end MCP protocol testing
- HTTP transport layer testing
- SSE transport layer testing
- Multi-client scenarios
- Concurrent operation testing

### Performance Test Gaps
- Load testing under high concurrency
- Memory leak detection
- Large dataset handling

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Step 2-8)
1. Create unit tests for knowledge-graph-manager.ts
2. Create unit tests for server-factory.ts and schemas
3. Create unit tests for monitoring components
4. Create unit tests for security validator
5. Create unit tests for cache and connection pool
6. Create unit tests for HTTP and health servers

### Short-term (Step 9-11)
1. Implement E2E tests for MCP protocol
2. Implement E2E tests for HTTP transport
3. Implement E2E tests for SSE transport

### Long-term (Step 12-14)
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with coverage reporting
2. Document testing strategy
3. Achieve and maintain 90%+ coverage

## Configuration Issues Fixed
- Excluded mcp-memory-fix directory from tsconfig and coverage
- Updated vitest.config.ts to properly include test files
- Fixed coverage include/exclude patterns

## Notes
- Current test suite has 222 passing tests across 8 test files
- Tests execute in ~13 seconds
- Coverage reporting is functional but thresholds not met
